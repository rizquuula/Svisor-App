# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 22, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **M Razif Rizqullah** ("Developer", "we", "us") operating under **Lyralabs** handles your information when you use the **Svisor** mobile application ("App"). Please read this policy carefully.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Google Account Information
When you sign in using Google Sign-In, we receive access to your:
- Google account email address
- Google account profile name and profile picture

This information is used solely to authenticate your identity and provide access to the App.

### 1.2 Google Drive & Google Sheets Data
The App accesses your Google Drive and Google Sheets through official Google APIs to:
- Read folder structures and file listings from your designated Drive folder
- Read and write data to Google Sheets documents (daily drilling reports)

We only access files and folders that you have explicitly authorized. We do not access, copy, or store your Drive or Sheets data outside of your own Google account.

### 1.3 Camera and Photo Library
The App may request access to your device's camera and photo library to allow you to capture and attach images to reports. Images captured through the App are used solely within the App's reporting functionality.

### 1.4 Local Device Storage
The App stores the following data locally on your device:
- **Authentication tokens**: Stored securely using encrypted storage to maintain your Google Sign-In session
- **User preferences**: App settings and preferences stored using local storage (e.g., selected language, theme)

No personal data is stored on external servers operated by the Developer.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information described above to:
- Authenticate you via Google Sign-In
- Fetch and display data from your Google Drive folders

## 4. Google API Services

Specifically:
- We only request the minimum necessary Google API scopes
- We do not use Google user data for advertising purposes

- **User preferences** are stored locally and can be cleared by uninstalling the App
- We do not retain your personal data on any Developer-operated servers

---

## 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information:
- Authentication tokens are stored using encrypted, secure storage on your device
- Communication with Google APIs uses HTTPS/TLS encryption
- We do not transmit your credentials to any Developer-operated servers

## 7. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

You can:
- **Revoke Google access** at any time via [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
